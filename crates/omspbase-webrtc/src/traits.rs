//! W3C PeerConnectionApi trait — the public W3C WebRTC API contract.
//!
//! This trait defines the standard W3C PeerConnection interface.
//! Currently implemented by `crate::peer_connection::RTCPeerConnection` struct.
//!
//! # Backend dispatch
//!
//! The trait is backend-agnostic. Backend selection happens at compile time
//! via `ActivePc` type alias in `crate::backend`.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use omspbase_webrtc::traits::PeerConnectionApi;
//!
//! fn use_pc(pc: &impl PeerConnectionApi) {
//!     pc.create_offer(&Default::default()).await.unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
